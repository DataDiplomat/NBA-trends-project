# NBA Trends Project

This project involves the analysis of National Basketball Association (NBA) data to explore associations between teams, win-rates, playoff appearances, and more. The goal is to gain insights into the relationships between different factors in the NBA dataset.

## Description

This project aims to analyze data from the NBA (National Basketball Association) and explore possible associations. The data used was originally sourced from 538's Analysis of the Complete History Of The NBA and contains the original, unmodified data from Basketball Reference, as well as additional variables added by 538 for analysis.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the provided files.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required packages by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn

## Usage

1. Place the nba_games.csv file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the Python script to perform the NBA data analysis.


## Results and Interpretation

The project performs a comprehensive analysis of NBA data, including the following steps:

1. Comparison of points in the 2010 and 2014 seasons.
2. Calculation of the average points scored by the Knicks and the Nets.
3. Visualization of the distribution of points scored by the Knicks and the Nets.
4. Detailed analysis of points scored per game by different franchises.
5. Exploration of win and loss trends at home and away.
6. Conversion of game result and location frequencies into proportions.
7. Calculation of Chi-Square statistics to determine associations between game results and locations.
8. Analysis of the reliability of 538's game predictions using covariance and correlation.
9. Visualization of the relationship between predicted win probabilities and point differentials.

## Future Steps

- Enhance the analysis with more advanced statistical methods.
- Include visualizations to better illustrate trends and correlations.
- Investigate other variables and their relationships within the NBA dataset.
- Consider implementing machine learning techniques for predictions or classifications.
